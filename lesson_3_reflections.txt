1.When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

I guess when working with other developers on the same project. For instance, shareing repository in Github. Other reason could be safety.

2.Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

For having a control on what changes to pull and what don't. You do not always want to introduce a recent changes to the code. 

3.Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Clone is a copy of whole project. Clone is used to copy a project from GitHub to your computer.
Fork is a clone of the whole project but only is used in GitHub enviroment.
Branch is usually a part of the project.

4.What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

Be aware of most recent changes and have up to date code.
